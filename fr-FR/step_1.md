Remember that the `<a>` (anchor) tag is used to create a link to another web page (not the 'link' tag which is used to link to resources such as fonts).

Also check that you have the correct web address (url) for the `href` property.

The part of a web address after the the domain name (such as 'projects.raspberrypi.org'), is case sensitive so you need to make sure capital letters match.

This example uses correct HTML to link to a web page that will open in a new browser tab:

## --- code ---

language: HTML
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
--------------------------------------------------------

<a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/web-intro" target="_blank">Make a web page like this!</a>

\--- /code ---
