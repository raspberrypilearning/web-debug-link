Remember that the `<a>` (anchor) tag is used to create a link to another webpage (not the 'link' tag, which is used to link to resources such as fonts).

Also check that you have the correct web address (URL) for the `href` property. 

The part of a web address after the domain name (such as 'projects.raspberrypi.org'), is case sensitive so you need to make sure the capital letters match. 

This example uses correct HTML to link to a webpage that opens in a new browser tab:

--- code ---
---
language: HTML
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---

<a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/web-intro" target="_blank">Make a webpage like this!</a>

--- /code ---
